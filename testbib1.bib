abstract = {The most common method for determining vorticity from planar velocity information is the circulation method. Its performance has been evaluated using a plane of velocity data obtained from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a three dimensional plane shear layer. Both the ability to reproduce the vorticity from the exact velocity field and one perturbed by a 5\% random "uncertainty" were assessed. To minimize the sensitivity to velocity uncertainties, a new method was developed using a least-squares approach. The local velocity data is fit to a model velocity field consisting of uniform translation, rigid rotation, a point source, and plane shear. The least-squares method was evaluated in the same manner as the circulation method. The largest differences between the actual and calculated vorticity fields were due to the filter-like nature of the methods. The new method is less sensitive to experi- mental uncertainty. However the circulation method proved to be slightly better at reproducing the DNS field. The least-squares method provides additional information beyond the circulation method results. Using the correlation overlinep'omegaomega and a vorticity threshold criteria to identify regions of rigid rotation (or eddies), the rigid rotation component of the least-squares method indicates these same regions.},

Above the viscous wall layer, the hairpin vortex paradigm of Theodorsen coupled with the quasistreamwise vortex paradigm have gained considerable support from multidimensional visualization using particle image velocimetry and direct numerical simulation experiments. Hairpins can autogenerate to form packets that populate a significant fraction of the boundary layer, even at very high Reynolds numbers. The dynamics of packet formation and the ramifications of organization of coherent structures (hairpins or packets) into larger-scale structures are discussed. Evidence for a large-scale mechanism in the outer layer suggests that further organization of packets may occur on scales equal to and larger than the boundary layer thickness.

The influence of Reynolds number on the response of isolated cylinders is presented and recent developments using forced vibration are discussed. The response of a cylinder free to respond in the in-line and transverse directions is contrasted with that of a cylinder responding in only one direction. The interference between two circular cylinders is discussed and prominence given to the case of cylinders in a tandem arrangement. The origin of the time-mean lift force on the downstream cylinder is considered together with the cause of the large amplitude transverse vibration experienced by the cylinder above vortex resonance. This wake-induced vibration is shown to be a form of vortex-induced vibration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the analysis of the linear stability of basic states in fluid mechanics that are slowly varying in space, the quasi-homogeneous hypothesis is often invoked, where the stability exponents are defined locally and treated as slowly varying functions of a spatial coordinate. The set of local stability exponents is then used to predict the global perturbation dynamics and an implicit hypothesis is that the local analysis provides at least a conservative estimate of the global stability properties of the flow. In this paper cautionary examples are presented that demonstrate a contradiction between the results of the local and global analyses. For example, a local analysis may predict stability everywhere even when the exact PDE with non-constant coefficients is ill-posed, demonstrating that global stability exponents are not, in general, bounded by the maximal local stability exponents. A key observation in this paper is the importance of distinguishing between the discrete spectrum and the continuous spectrum when comparing global and local stability exponents. This distinction is particularly significant for spatially periodic flows where, for the global flow, only the continuous spectrum is present and, hence, instability arises always in the absence of discrete spectra. New exact definitions for global absolute and convective instabilities are also given for a class of spatially periodic basic states and applied to an example based on the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation. The consequences of this example, and of the argument involved for basic states that are slowly varying in space but non-periodic, and for some problems in fluid mechanics are also presented.},

abstract = {A scheme using the mesh-free generalized finite differencing (GFD) on flows past moving bodies is proposed. The aim is to devise a method to simulate flow past an immersed moving body that avoids the intensive remeshing of the computational domain and minimizes data interpolation associated with the established computational fluid methodologies; as such procedures are time consuming and are a significant source of error in flow simulation. In the present scheme, the moving body is embedded and enveloped by a cloud of mesh-free nodes, which convects with the motion of the body against a background of Cartesian nodes. The generalized finite-difference (GFD) method with weighted least squares (WLS) approximation is used to discretize the two-dimensional viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations at the mesh-free nodes, while standard finite-difference approximations are applied elsewhere. The convecting motion of the mesh-free nodes is treated by the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the flow equations, which are solved by a second-order Crank-Nicolson based projection method. The proposed numerical scheme was tested on a number of problems including the decaying-vortex flow, external flows past moving bodies and body-driven flows in enclosures. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The operating principles of pressure determination using a Eulerian or a Lagrangian approach are described together with theoretical considerations on its expected performance. These considerations are verified by a performance assessment on a synthetic flow field. Based on these results, guidelines regarding the temporal and spatial resolution required are proposed. The interrogation window size needs to be 5 times smaller than the flow structures and the acquisition frequency needs to be 10 times higher than the corresponding flow frequency (e.g. Eulerian time scales for the Eulerian approach). To further assess the experimental viability of the pressure evaluation methods, stereoscopic PIV and tomographic PIV experiments on a square cylinder flow (Re (D) = 9,500) were performed, employing surface pressure data for validation. The experimental results were found to support the proposed guidelines.},

abstract = {Taylor’s hypothesis is often applied in turbulent flow analysis to map temporal information into spatial information. Recent efforts in deriving pressure from particle image velocimetry (PIV) have proposed multiple approaches, each with its own weakness and strength. Application of Taylor’s hypothesis allows us to counter the weakness of an Eulerian approach that is described by de Kat and van Oudheusden (2012 Exp. Fluids 52 1089–106). Two different approaches of using Taylor’s hypothesis in determining planar pressure are investigated: one where pressure is determined from volumetric PIV data and one where pressure is determined from time-resolved stereoscopic PIV data. A performance assessment on synthetic data shows that application of Taylor’s hypothesis can improve determination of pressure from PIV data significantly compared with a time-resolved volumetric approach. The technique is then applied to time-resolved PIV data taken in a cross-flow plane of a turbulent jet (Ganapathisubramani et al 2007 Exp. Fluids 42 923–39). Results appear to indicate that pressure can indeed be obtained from PIV data in turbulent convective flows using the Taylor’s hypothesis approach, where there are no other methods to determine pressure. The role of convection velocity in determination of pressure is also discussed.},

The pressure field, combined with the velocity field, gives a complete description of the (incompressible) flow dynamics. Furthermore the pressure field is the main contributor to the aerodynamic loading of bodies immersed in the fluid. Traditional techniques to determine pressure and forces rely on the determination of surface pressure and integral loads by point pressure and force balance measurements. In situations where it is difficult (or impossible) to instrument the body, using particle image velocimetry (PIV) velocity data to determine forces and pressure poses an interesting alternative to the existing approaches to determine sectional loading.},

abstract = {We investigate the laminar shedding of hairpin vortices in the wake of a truncated square cylinder placed in a duct, for Reynolds numbers around the critical threshold of the onset of vortex shedding. We single out the formation mechanism of the hairpin vortices by means of a detailed analysis of the flow patterns in the steady regime. We show that unlike in previous studies of similar structures, the dynamics of the hairpin vortices is entwined with that of the counter-rotating pair of streamwise vortices, which we found to be generated in the bottom part of the near wake (these are usually referred to as base vortices). In particular, once the hairpin structure is released, the base vortices attach to it, forming its legs, so these are streamwise, and not spanwise as previously observed in unconfined wakes or behind cylinders of lower aspect ratios. We also single out a trail of Omega-shaped vortices, generated between successive hairpin vortices through a mechanism that is analogous to that active in near-wall turbulence. Finally, we show how the dynamics of the structures we identified determine the evolution of the drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers when the Reynolds number varies.},

The results are summarized in tables and graphs, and can be applied to problems of dynamic loading of structures, and also to relate experimental results on fluctuating lift, obtained on a cylinder slice of finite length l, to the fluctuating lift coefficient at a section. The degree of coherence of the cylinder wake, i.e. its more or less two-dimensional or three-dimensional character, may be evaluated from the spanwise correlation length of fluctuating lift, $\lambda$2.},

abstract = {The effect of fins on vortex shedding and acoustic resonance is investigated for isolated and two tandem cylinders exposed to cross-flow in a rectangular duct. Three spacing ratios between the tandem cylinders (S/De=1.5, 2 and 3) are tested for a Reynolds number range from 1.6×104 to 1.1×105. Measurements of sound pressure as well as mean and fluctuating velocities are performed for bare and finned cylinders with three different fin densities. The effect of fins on the sound pressure generated before the onset of acoustic resonance as well as during the pre-coincidence and coincidence resonance is found to be rather complex and depends on the spacing ratio between cylinders, the fin density and the nature of the flow-sound interaction mechanism. For isolated cylinders, the fins reduce the strength of vortex shedding only slightly, but strongly attenuate the radiated sound before and during the occurrence of acoustic resonance. This suggests that the influence of the fins on correlation length is stronger than on velocity fluctuations. In contrast to isolated cylinders, the fins in the tandem cylinder case enhance the vortex shedding process at off-resonant conditions, except for the large spacing case which exhibits a reversed effect at high Reynolds numbers. Regarding the acoustic resonance of the tandem cylinders, the fins promote the onset of the coincidence resonance, but increasing the fin density drastically weakens the intensity of this resonance. The fins are also found to suppress the pre-coincidence resonance for the tandem cylinders with small spacing ratios (S/De=1.5, 2 and 2), but for the largest spacing case (S/De=3), they are found to have minor effects on the sound pressure and the lock-in range of the pre-coincidence resonance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the present experimental investigation the surface pressure distribution, vortex shedding frequency, and the wake flow behind a porous circular cylinder are studied when continuous suction or blowing is applied through the cylinder walls. It is found that even moderate levels of suction/blowing ( ≲ 5 \% of the oncoming streamwise velocity) have a large impact on the flow around the cylinder. Suction delays separation contributing to a narrower wake width, and a corresponding reduction of drag, whereas blowing shows the opposite behaviour. Both uniform suction and blowing display unexpected flow features which are analysed in detail. Suction shows a decrease of the turbulence intensity throughout the whole wake when compared with the natural case, whilst blowing only shows an effect up to five diameters downstream of the cylinder. The drag on the cylinder is shown to increase linearly with the blowing rate, whereas for suction there is a drastic decrease at a specific suction rate. This is shown to be an effect of the separation point moving towards the rear part of the cylinder, similar to what happens when transition to turbulence occurs in the boundary layer on a solid cylinder. The suction/blowing rate can empirically be represented by an effective Reynolds number for the solid cylinder, and an analytical expression for this Reynolds number representation is proposed and verified. Flow visualizations expose the complexity of the flow field in the near wake of the cylinder, and image averaging enables the retrieval of quantitative information, such as the vortex formation length. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An experimental method for evaluating pressure field and fluid forces on a bluff body structure is studied using instantaneous velocity data measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). This method solves a pressure Poisson equation numerically with the experimental velocity data by PIV. The measurement of the velocity field around a circular cylinder is carried out using two CCD cameras placed side by side, which allows simultaneous measurement of velocity near and far field around the circular cylinder. The pressure and fluid forces on the stationary cylinder evaluated by this method agree closely with those in the literature, suggesting the validity of this technique. The present technique is also applied to a circular cylinder with rotational oscillation at Reynolds number 2000. It is found that the drag force on a circular cylinder is magnified at low-frequency oscillation and reduced at high-frequency oscillation. The drag coefficient at high-frequency oscillation is reduced by 30\% with respect to the stationary cylinder, while the fluctuating lift is slightly increased due to the generation of synchronized vortex shedding at high-frequency oscillation.},

Downstream of a short initial decay region, where the intensities decrease rapidly, the return to isotropy was found to be much slower than for the unmanipulated turbulence. The latter was generated by a square rod grid, and was shown to become practically isotropic beyond a distance of roughly 20 mesh widths from the grid.

abstract = {Considerable confusion surrounds the longstanding question of what constitutes a vortex, especially in a turbulent flow. This question, frequently misunderstood as academic, has recently acquired particular significance since coherent structures (CS) in turbulent flows are now commonly regarded as vortices. An objective definition of a vortex should permit the use of vortex dynamics concepts to educe CS, to explain formation and evolutionary dynamics of CS, to explore the role of CS in turbulence phenomena, and to develop viable turbulence models and control strategies for turbulence phenomena. We propose a definition of a vortex in an incompressible flow in terms of the eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor S2+a2; here S and 0 are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor Vu. This definition captures the pressure minimum in a plane perpendicular to the vortex axis at high Reynolds numbers, and also accurately defines vortex cores at low Reynolds numbers, unlike a pressure-minimum criterion. We compare our definition with prior schemes/definitions using exact and numerical solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for a variety of laminar and turbulent flows. In contrast to definitions based on the positive second invariant of Vu or the complex eigenvalues of Vu, our definition accurately identifies the vortex core in flows where the vortex geometry is intuitively clear.},

This streamwise vortex pair is an idealization of the connection back to the stack tip of the vertical von Karman vortices shed from the stack. The model is compared with the measurements of trajectories from non-buoyant momentum jets injected from a circular tube with subcritical external Reynolds number into a uniform cross how in a water channel. Fluorescent dye and laser sheet-lighting were used to define the trajectories over a range of effluent to crosswind velocity ratios from 0.25 to 8.0. With an empirical function to account for the efficiency with which the jet entrains vorticity from the stack-tip vortex pair, the model accurately predicts the plume downwash effects, and accounts for the continuous downward deflection of the jet trajectory.},

abstract = {The flow pattern behind a circular cylinder is associated with various instabilities. These instabilities are characterized by the Reynolds number and include the wake, separated shear layer and boundary layer. Depending on the physical application of the cylinder, increasing the level of turbulence on the surface of the cylinder would be a target for drag reduction or heat transfer enhancement. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) has been carried out to investigate the wake region behind a foamed and a finned cylinder. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the flow characteristics for these two cases. The experiments are conducted for a wide range of Reynolds numbers (based on the mean air velocity and the cylinder diameter) from 1000 to 10,000. Two dimensional results of planar PIV reveal the important aspects of the local flow features of the circular finned and foamed cylinders. These include turbulent boundary layer development over the surface and a delayed separation of the flow resulting in a smaller wake size at each speed. The application of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to the PIV velocity fields of the two cylinder types is also discussed. The POD computed for the measured velocity fields for all cases shows that the first two spatial modes contain most of the kinetic energy of the flow, irrespective to the cylinder type. These two modes are also responsible for the large-scale coherence of the fluctuations. For three different cylinder types, the first four eigenmodes of the flow field were calculated and their structures were analyzed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Vortex-induced vibrations of a pivoted, rigid, circular cylinder were investigated experimentally. A cylinder with a mass ratio of 15.9 and a moment of inertia ratio of 66.8 was investigated at a constant Reynolds number of 2100 for a range of reduced velocities, 3.4???U 
                        *???11.3, and damping ratios, 0.4\%????????1.1\%. A novel experimental set-up was designed to reproduce the orbiting response observed in some engineering applications involving vortex induced vibrations of cylindrical structures. The results show that, in the synchronization region, the frequencies of transverse and streamwise vibrations lock onto the natural frequency of the structure, and the cylinder traces elliptic trajectories. A mathematical model is introduced to investigate the mechanism responsible for the occurrence of the elliptic trajectories or the figure-8 type trajectories observed in previous laboratory studies. The results show that the occurrence of either elliptic or figure-8 type trajectory is governed primarily by structural coupling between vibrations in streamwise and transverse directions. Based on the experimental results, four distinct types of orbiting motion are identified in the synchronization region. Each of these four types corresponds to a specific range of phase angles between the streamwise and transverse vibrations defining the orientation of the trajectory and the direction of orbiting. The results indicate that the identified four types of elliptic trajectories are associated with four distinct ranges of a dimensionless parameter used to quantify structural coupling. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The flow around a finite circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio of 6 was studied using large eddy simulation (LES). The cylinder was mounted on a ground plane where a thin boundary layer with a thickness of only 7\% of the cylinder’s diameter was formed. The flow resulting from the present LES was used to present a detailed picture of both the instantaneous and the time-averaged flow. Among the results of the present study is the explanation for the formation of two time-averaged tip vortices from two pairs of instantaneous vortices. The main recirculation region on the cylinder’s top was found to be one vortex with both legs attached to the top surface, in agreement with some previous investigations. The mean flow in the near wake region was found to contain two horseshoe vortices, one large arch vortex stretching from the cylinder’s top and another vortex resulting from the flow moving down below the rear stagnation point on the cylinder. The instantaneous horseshoe vortex near the ground was found to be unsteady and changed shape over time. The time-averaged flow showed three complete horseshoe vortices, in agreement with previous knowledge. The downwash process above the free end into the near wake occurs at a rather constant angle with respect to the plane normal to the streamwise direction. The same angle was preserved in the inclination of the arch vortex in the time-averaged flow},

abstract = {Abstract\~{}\~{}This paper describes a non-intrusive technique for measuring the instantaneous spatial pressure distribution over a sample area in a flow field. A four-exposure PIV system is used for measuring the distribution of material acceleration by comparing the velocity of the same group of particles at different times and then integrating it to obtain the pressure distribution. Exposing both cameras to the same particle field at the same time and cross-correlating the images enables precision matching of the two fields of view. Application of local image deformation correction to velocity vectors measured by the two cameras reduces the error due to relative misalignment and image distortion to about 0.01\~{}pixels in synthetic images. An omni-directional virtual boundary integration scheme is introduced to integrate the acceleration while minimizing the effect of the local random errors in acceleration. Further improvements are achieved by iterations to correct the pressure along the boundary. Typically 3-5 iterations are sufficient for reducing the incremental mean pressure change in each iteration to less than 0.1\% of the dynamic pressure. Validation tests of the principles of the technique using synthetic images of rotating and stagnation point flows show that the standard deviation of the measured pressure from the exact value is about 1.0\%. This system is used to measure the instantaneous pressure and acceleration distributions of a 2D cavity turbulent flow field and sample results are presented.},

Three involatile esters (pentadecalactone, coumarin, and cinnamyl butyrate) predicted by gas chromatographic data to be strongly retarded by the olfactory mucus showed similar significant changes in sensitivity. By contrast, a more volatile ester (amyl acetate) predicted to diffuse more readily though the mucus showed no such changes. This suggests that variantions in olfactory sensitivity observed between ovulation and menstruation depend on odorant volatility and thus may result from peripheral mechanisms limiting the access of odorant molecules to the olfactory receptors.},

abstract = {\% It has been known for some time that two-dimensional numerical simulations of flow over nominally two-dimensional bluff bodies at Reynolds numbers for which the flow is intrinsically three dimensional, lead to inaccurate prediction of the lift and drag forces. In particular, for flow past a normal flat plate (International Symposium on Nckzsteady Fluid Dynamics, edited by J. A. Miller and D. P. Telionis, 1990, pp. 455-464) and circular cylinders [J. Wmd Eng. Indus. Aerodyn. 35,275 (1990)], it has been noted that the drag coefficient computed from two-dimensional simulations is significantly higher than what is obtained from experiments. Furthermore, it has been found that three-dimensional simulations of flows lead to accurate prediction of drag [J. Wind Eng. Indus. Aerodyn. 35, 275 (1990)]. Th e underlying cause for this discrepancy is that the surface pressure distribution obtained from two-dimensional simulations does not match up with that obtained from experiments and three-dimensional simulations and a number of reasons have been put forward to explain this discrepancy. However, the details of the physical mechanisms that ultimately lead to the inaccurate prediction of surface pressure and consequently the lift and drag, are still not clear. In the present study, results of two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of flow past elliptic and circular cylinders have been systematically compared in an effort to pinpoint the exact cause for the inaccurate prediction of the lift and drag by two-dimensional simulations. The overprediction of mean drag force in two-dimensional simulations is directly traced to higher Reynolds stresses in the wake. It is also found that the discrepancy in the drag between two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations is more pronounced for bluffer cylinders. Finally, the current study also provides a detailed view of how the fluctuation, which are associated with the K\&n\& vortex shedding in the wake, affect the mean pressure distribution and the aerodynamic forces on the body. },

abstract = {A dual-step cylinder is comprised of two cylinders of different diameters. A large diameter cylinder (D) with low aspect ratio (L/D) is attached to the mid-span of a small diameter cylinder (d). The present study investigates the effect of Reynolds number (ReD) and L/D on dual step cylinder wake development for D/d=2, 0.2???L/D???3, and two Reynolds numbers, ReD=1050 and 2100. Experiments have been performed in a water flume facility utilizing flow visualization, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The results show that vortex shedding occurs from both the large and small diameter cylinders for 1???L/D???3 at ReD=2100 and 2???L/D???3 at ReD=1050. At these conditions, large cylinder vortices predominantly form vortex loops in the wake and small cylinder vortices form half-loop vortex connections. At lower aspect ratios, vortex shedding from the large cylinder ceases, with the dominant frequency in the large cylinder wake attributed to the passage of vortex filaments connecting small cylinder vortices. At these lower aspect ratios, the presence of the large cylinder induces periodic vortex dislocations. Increasing L/D increases the frequency of occurrence of vortex dislocations and decreases the dominant frequency in the large cylinder wake. The identified changes in wake topology are related to substantial variations in the location of boundary layer separation on the large cylinder, and, consequently, changes in the size of the vortex formation region. The results also show that the Reynolds number has a substantial effect on wake vortex shedding frequency, which is more profound than that expected for a uniform cylinder. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Flow past a circular cylinder with a single stepwise discontinuity in diameter was investigated numerically for the diameter ratio D/d = 2 and two Reynolds numbers, ReD = 150 and 300. The primary focus was on vortex shedding and vortex interactions occurring in the cylinder wake. In agreement with previous experimental findings, three distinct spanwise vortex cells were identified in the step-cylinder wake: a single vortex shedding cell in the wake of the small cylinder (the S-cell) and two vortex shedding cells in the wake of the large cylinder, one in the region downstream of the step (the N-cell) and the other away from the step (the L-cell). Due to the differences in vortex shedding frequencies, complex vortex connections occurred in two vortex interaction regions located between the adjacent cells. However, distinct differences in vortex splitting and vortex dislocations were identified in the two regions. The region at the boundary between the S-cell and the N-cell was relatively narrow and its spanwise extent did not fluctuate significantly. In this region, vortex dislocations manifested as half-loop connections between two S-cell vortices of opposite sign. In contrast, the region at the boundary between the N-cell and the L-cell exhibited transient behavior, with large scale vortex dislocations causing cyclic variation in the extent of N-cell vortices. Spectral analysis of velocity data showed that the presence of the N-cell was continuous through all simulations. For ReD = 300, small scale streamwise vortices forming in the wake of the large cylinder weaken the primary spanwise vortices and vortex connections, complicating vortex dynamics in the step-cylinder wake. However, no significant Reynolds number effect on the average spanwise extent of the vortex cells and the two transition regions between neighboring cells was observed. Finally, formation of N-cell vortices was shown to be linked to downwash fluctuations near the step.},

abstract = {Particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is applied to flows around a Savonius turbine. The velocity vector field measured with PTV is utilized to estimate the pressure field around the turbine, as well as to evaluate the torque performance. The main objective of the work is the establishment of the pressure estimation scheme required to discuss the turbine performance. First, the PTV data are interpolated on a regular grid with a fourth-order ellipsoidal differential equation to generate velocity vectors satisfying the third-order spatio-temporal continuity both in time and space. Second, the phase-averaged velocity vector information with respect to the turbine angle is substituted into three different types of pressure-estimating equations, i.e. the Poisson equation, the Navier–Stokes equation and the sub-grid scale model of turbulence. The results obtained based on the Navier–Stokes equation are compared with those based on the Poisson equation, and have shown several merits in employing the Navier–Stokes-based method for the PTV measurement. The method is applied to a rotating turbine with the tip-speed ratio of 0.5 to find the relationship between torque behaviour and flow structure in a phase-averaged sense. We have found that a flow attached to the convex surface of the blades induces low-pressure regions to drive the turbine, namely, the lift force helps the turbine blades to rotate even when the drag force is insufficient. Secondary mechanisms of torque generation are also discussed.},

abstract = {The free end effect on the near wake of a finite circular cylinder in a cross flow has been investigated experimentally. Three finite cylinders with aspect ratios (L=D) of 6, 10 and 13 were tested in a subsonic wind tunnel at a Reynolds number of 20 000. A hot-wire anemometer was employed to measure the wake velocity. Mean pressure distributions on the cylinder surface were also measured. The flow near the free end was visualized to observe the flow structure qualitatively in a circulating water channel. The experimental results from these finite cylinder (FC) models were compared with those of a two-dimensional circular cylinder. The flow past the FC free end shows a complicated three-dimensional wake structure. As the FC aspect ratio decreases, the vortex shedding frequency is decreased and the vortex formation region is elongated. The free end effect becomes dominant close to the FC free end. The three- dimensionality of the FC wake may be attributed mainly to the strong entrainment of irrotational fluids, caused by the downwash of counter-rotating vortices separated from the FC free end. The downwash flow is concentrated in the central region of the wake. A peculiar flow structure having a 24Hz frequency component was observed near the free end using spectral analysis and cross-correlation of the velocity signals. This 24Hz frequency component is closely related to the counter-rotating twin vortices formed near the FC free end.},

abstract = {The shedding process in the near wake of a surface-mounted, square cross-section cylinder of height-to-width aspect ratio 4 at a Reynolds number of 12,000 based on free-stream velocity and the obstacle width was investigated. The boundary layer thickness was 0.18 obstacle heights based on 99\% free-stream velocity. The study is performed using planar high frame-rate particle image velocimetry synchronized with pressure measurements and hot-wire anemometry. Spatial cross-correlation, instantaneous phase relationships, and phase-averaged velocity data are reported. Two dominant vortex-shedding regimes are observed. During intervals of high-amplitude pressure fluctuations on the obstacle side faces, alternate formation and shedding of vortices is observed (regime A) similar to the von Karman process. Regime B is characterized by two co-existing vortices in the obstacle lee throughout the shedding cycle and is observed within low-amplitude pressure fluctuation intervals. Despite the coexisting vortices in the base region, opposite sign vorticity is still shed out-of-phase downstream of this vortex pair giving rise to a staggered arrangement of counter-rotating vortices downstream. While the probability of occurrence of Regime B increases toward the free end, the amplitude modulation remains coherent along the obstacle height. Conditionally phase-averaged reconstructions of the flow field are consistent with the spatial distribution of the phase relationships and their probability density function. Earlier observations are reconciled showing that the symmetric shedding of vortices is a rare occurrence.},

abstract = {A novel technique is introduced to increase the precision and robustness of time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) measurements. The innovative element of the technique is the linear combination of the correlation signal computed at different separation time intervals. The domain of the correlation signal resulting from different temporal separations is matched via homothetic transformation prior to the averaging of the correlation maps. The resulting ensemble-averaged correlation function features a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio and a more precise velocity estimation due to the evaluation of a larger particle image displacement. The method relies on a local optimization of the observation time between snapshots taking into account the local out-of-plane motion, continuum deformation due to in-plane velocity gradient and acceleration errors. The performance of the pyramid correlation algorithm is assessed on a synthetically generated image sequence reproducing a three-dimensional Batchelor vortex; experiments conducted in air and water flows are used to assess the performance on time-resolved PIV image sequences. The numerical assessment demonstrates the effectiveness of the pyramid correlation technique in reducing both random and bias errors by a factor 3 and one order of magnitude, respectively. The experimental assessment yields a significant increase of signal strength indicating enhanced measurement robustness. Moreover, the amplitude of noisy fluctuations is considerably attenuated and higher precision is obtained for the evaluation of time-resolved velocity and acceleration.},

abstract = {Detached-eddy simulation (DES) was first proposed in 1997 and first used in 1999, so its full history can be surveyed. A DES community has formed, with adepts and critics, as well as new branches. The initial motivation of high–Reynolds number, massively separated flows remains, for which DES is convincingly more capable presently than either unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES). This review discusses compelling examples, noting the visual and quantitative success of DES. Its principal weakness is its response to ambiguous grids, in which the wall-parallel grid spacing is of the order of the boundary-layer thickness. In some situations, DES on a given grid is then less accurate than RANS on the same grid or DES on a coarser grid. Partial remedies have been found, yet dealing with thickening boundary layers and shallow separation bubbles is a central challenge. The nonmonotonic response of DES to grid refinement is disturbing to most observers, as is the absence of...},

@article{Sumner2013,
abstract = {The wake of a surface-mounted finite-height circular cylinder and the associated vortex patterns are strongly dependent on the cylinder aspect ratio and the thickness of the boundary layer on the ground plane relative to the dimensions of the cylinder. Above a critical aspect ratio, the mean wake is characterized by streamwise tip vortex structures and K\'{a}rm\'{a}n vortex shedding from the sides of the cylinder. Below a critical aspect ratio, a unique mean wake structure is observed. Recent experimental studies in the literature that used phase-averaged techniques, as well as recent numerical simulations, have led to an improved physical understanding of the near-wake vortex flow patterns. However, the flow above the free end of the finite circular cylinder, and its relationship to the near wake, has not been systematically studied. The effects of aspect ratio and boundary layer thickness on the free-end flow field are also not completely understood, nor has the influence of Reynolds number on the free-end flow field been fully explored. Common features associated with the free end include separation from the leading edge, a mean recirculation zone containing a prominent cross-stream arch (or mushroom) vortex, and reattachment onto the free-surface. Other flow features that remain to be clarified include a separation bubble near the leading edge, one or two cross-stream vortices within this separation bubble, the origins of the streamwise tip or trailing vortices, and various critical points in the near-surface flow topology. This paper reviews the current understanding of the flow above the free end of a surface-mounted finite-height circular cylinder, with a focus on models of the flow field, surface oil flow visualization studies, pressure and heat flux distributions on the free-end surface, measurements of the local velocity field, and numerical simulations, found in the literature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Teitel2009,
abstract = {The use of screens to reduce insect entry into greenhouses has become a common practice. Screens act as mechanical barriers that prevent migratory insects from reaching the plants. However, they impede ventilation thereby increasing air temperature and humidity within the enclosures. In an attempt to explore ways by which ventilation can be improved, the effect of screen inclination on flow parameters downstream the screen was investigated experimentally and by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Experiments were done in a wind tunnel and CFD simulations were conducted by using the ANSYS-CFX 11 software package. The CFD code was first validated by comparing between the numerical and experimental velocity profiles downstream inclined screens with different porosities. In the validation stage the screens were inclined at 45??, 90?? and 135??, (angle measured between the floor upstream and the screen plane). The validated code was used to determine the effect of screen inclination on mass flow rate through the screen and on airflow-induced forces that act on the screen. The effect of screen porosity was examined by using screens of different porosities (0.4, 0.52 and 0.62). The experimental and CFD results were in good agreement with respect to the velocity magnitude for a screen placed at 90??. Fair agreement was observed with an inclined screen that is placed at either 45?? or 135??. However, at both 45?? and 135?? the agreement with respect to trends in air velocity vertical distribution downstream the screen was good. When the screen was placed at 90?? to the floor, the air velocity downstream the screen was almost constant with height. With inclined screens the velocity increased with height for 45?? and decreased with height for 135?? inclination. A wider range of inclinations (30-150??) was used in the simulations to systematically study the effect of inclination on the mass flow rate through the screens and on the forces on the screens. The CFD results show that for all porosities the mass flow rate through screens that are inclined 45?? was higher than through screens inclined at 135??. The higher mass flow rate at 45?? was associated with larger force acting on the screen. The force acting at 45?? was always greater than at 135??. ?? 2009 IAgrE.},

abstract = {The topic of this article is a review of the approach to extract pressure fields from flow velocity field data, typically obtained with particle image velocimetry (PIV), by combining the experimental data with the governing equations. Although the basic working principles on which this procedure relies have been known for quite some time, the recent expansion of PIV capabilities has greatly increased its practical potential, up to the extent that nowadays a time-resolved volumetric pressure determination has become feasible. This has led to a novel diagnostic methodology for determining the instantaneous flow field pressure in a non-intrusive way, which is rapidly finding acceptance in an increasing variety of application areas. The current review describes the operating principles, illustrating how the flow-governing equations, in particular the equation of momentum, are employed to compute the pressure from the material acceleration of the flow. Accuracy aspects are discussed in relation to the most dominating experimental influences, notably the accuracy of the velocity source data, the temporal and spatial resolution and the method invoked to estimate the material derivative. In view of its nature of an emerging technique, recently published dedicated validation studies will be given specific attention. Different application areas are addressed, including turbulent flows, aeroacoustics, unsteady wing aerodynamics and other aeronautical applications. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reports an experimental investigation of the near wake of a finite-length square cylinder, with one end mounted on a flat plate and the other free. The cylinder aspect ratio or height-to-width ratio H/d ranges from 3 to 7. Measurements were carried out mainly in a closed-loop low-speed wind tunnel at a Reynolds number Red, based on d and the free-stream velocity of 9300 using hot-wire anemometry, laser Doppler anemometry and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The planar PIV measurements were performed in the three orthogonal planes of the three- dimensional cylinder wake, along with flow visualization conducted simultaneously in two orthogonal planes (Red =221). Three types of vortices, i.e. the tip, base and spanwise vortices were observed and the near wake is characterized by the interactions of these vortices. Both flow visualization and two-point correlation point to an inherent connection between the three types of vortices. A model is proposed for the three-dimensional flow structure based on the present measurements, which is distinct from previously proposed models. The instantaneous flow structure around the cylinder is arch-type, regardless of H/d, consisting of two spanwise vortical ‘legs’, one on each side of the cylinder, and their connection or ‘bridge’ near the free end. Both tip and base vortices are the streamwise projections of the arch-type structure in the (y, z) plane, associated with the free-end downwash flow and upwash flow from the wall, respectively. Other issues such as the topological characteristics, spatial arrangement and interactions among the vortical structures are also addressed.},

abstract = {The effect of cylinder aspect ratio (a parts per thousand H/d, where H is the cylinder height or length, and d is the cylinder diameter) on the drag of a wall-mounted finite-length circular cylinder in both subcritical and critical regimes is experimentally investigated. Two cases are considered: a smooth cylinder submerged in a turbulent boundary layer and a roughened cylinder immersed in a laminar uniform flow. In the former case, the Reynolds number Re (d) (a parts per thousand U (a) d/nu, with U (a) being the free-stream velocity and nu the fluid viscosity) was varied from 2.61 x 10(4) to 2.87 x 10(5), and two values of H/d (2.65 and 5) were examined; in the latter case, Re (d) = 1.24 x 10(4)-1.73 x 10(5) and H/d = 3, 5 and 7. In the subcritical regime, both the drag coefficient C (D) and the Strouhal number St are smaller than their counterparts for a two-dimensional cylinder and reduce monotonously with decreasing H/d. The presence of a turbulent boundary layer causes an early transition from the subcritical to critical regime and considerably enlarges the Re (d) range of the critical regime. No laminar separation bubble occurs on the finite-length cylinder immersed in the turbulent boundary layer, and consequently, the discontinuity is not observed in the C (D)-Re (d) and St-Re (d) curves. In the roughened cylinder case, the Re (d) range of the critical regime grows gradually with decreasing H/d, while the C (D) crisis becomes less obvious. In both cases, H/d has a negligible effect on the critical value of Re (d) at which transition occurs from the subcritical to critical regime.},

abstract = {It is now well-known that the wake transition regime for a circular cylinder involves two modes of small-scale three-dimensional instability (modes A and B), depending on the regime of Reynolds number (Re), although almost no understanding of the physical origins of these instabilities, or indeed their effects on near-wake formation, have hitherto been made clear. We address these questions in this paper. In particular, it is found that the two different modes A and B scale on different physical features of the flow. Mode A has a larger spanwise wavelength of around 3-4 diameters, and scales on the larger physical structure in the flow, namely the primary vortex core. The wavelength for mode A is shown to be the result of an ‘elliptic instability’ in the near- wake vortex cores. The subsequent nonlinear growth of vortex loops is due to a feedback from one vortex to the next, involving spanwise-periodic deformation of core vorticity, which is then subject to streamwise stretching in the braid regions. This mode gives an out-of-phase streamwise vortex pattern. In contrast, mode-B instability has a distinctly smaller wavelength (1 diameter) which scales on the smaller physical structure in the flow, the braid shear layer. It is a manifest- ation of an instability in a region of hyperbolic flow. It is quite distinct from other shear flows, in that it depends on the reverse flow of the bluff-body wake; the presence of a fully formed streamwise vortex system, brought upstream from a previous half- cycle, in proximity to the newly evolving braid shear layer, leads to an in-phase stream- wise vortex array, in strong analogy with the ‘Mode 1 ’ 345 of Meiburg \& Lasheras (1988) for a forced unsepardted wake. In mode B, we also observe amalgamation of streamwise vortices from a previous braid with like-sign vortices in the subsequent braid. It is deduced that the large scatter in previous measurements concerning mode A is due to the presence of vortex dislocations. Dislocations are triggered at the sites of some vortex loops of mode A, and represent a natural breakdown of the periodicity of mode A instability. By minimizing or avoiding the dislocations which occur from end contamination or which occur during wake transition, we find an excellent agreement of both critical Re and spanwise wavelength of mode A with the recent secondary stability analysis of Barkley \& Henderson (1996). Wake transition is further characterized by velocity and pressure measurements. It is consistent that, when mode-A instability and large-scale dislocations appear, one finds a reduction of base suction, a reduction of (two-dimensional) Reynolds stress level, a growth in size of the formation region, and a corresponding drop in Strouhal frequency. Finally, the present work leads us to a new clarification of the possible flow states through transition. Right through this regime of Re, there exist two distinct and continuous Strouhal frequency curves : the upper one corresponds with purely small- scale instabilities (e.g. denoted as mode A), while the lower curve corresponds with a combination of small-scale plus dislocation structures (e.g. mode A*). However, some of the flow states are transient or ‘unstable’, and the natural transitioning wake appears to follow the scenario : (2D + A* -+ B).},

abstract = {Two fundamental characteristics of the low-Reynolds-number cylinder wake, which have involved considerable debate, are first the existence of discontinuities in the Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship, and secondly the phenomenon of oblique vortex shedding. The present paper shows that both of these characteristics of the wake are directly related to each other, and that both are influenced by the boundary conditions at the ends of the cylinder, even for spans of hundreds of diameters in length. It is found that a Strouhal discontinuity exists, which is not due to any of the previously proposed mechanisms, but instead is caused by a transition from one oblique shedding mode to another oblique mode. This transition is explained by a change from one mode where the central flow over the span matches the end boundary conditions to one where the central flow is unable to match the end conditions. In the latter case, quasi-periodic spectra of the velocity fluctuations appear; these are due to the presence of spanwise cells of different frequency. During periods when vortices in neighbouring cells move out of phase with each other, ‘vortex dislocations’ are observed, and are associated with rather complex vortex linking between the cells. However, by manipulating the end boundary conditions, parallel shedding can be induced, which then results in a completely continuous Strouhal curve. It is also universal in the sense that the oblique-shedding Strouhal data (S$\theta$) can be collapsed onto the parallel-shedding Strouhal curve (S0) by the transformation, S0 = S$\theta$/cos$\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle of oblique shedding. Close agreement between measurements in two distinctly different facilities confirms the continuous and universal nature of this Strouhal curve. It is believed that the case of parallel shedding represents truly two-dimensional shedding, and a comparison of Strouhal frequency data is made with several two-dimensional numerical simulations, yielding a large disparity which is not clearly understood. The oblique and parallel modes of vortex shedding are both intrinsic to the flow over a cylinder, and are simply solutions to different problems, because the boundary conditions are different in each case.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional transition of the flow behind a bluff body is studied, with an emphasis placed on the evolution of large-scale structures in the wake. It has previously been found that there are two fundamental modes of three-dimensional vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder (each mode being dependent on the range of Reynolds number), with a spanwise lengthscale of the same order as the primary streamwise wavelength of the vortex street. However. it is shown in the present study that the wake transition also involves the appearance of large-scale spot-like ‘vortex dislocations’, that grow downstream to a size of the order of 10–20 primary wavelengths. Vortex dislocations are generated between spanwise vortex-shedding cells of different frequency. The presence of these dislocations explains the large intermittent velocity irregularities that were originally found by Roshko (1954) and later by Bloor (1964) to characterize transition. The presence of these vortex dislocations in wake transition is largely responsible for the break-up to turbulence of the wake as it travels downstream. In order to study their evolution in detail, dislocations have been (passively) forced to occur at a local spanwise position with the use of a small ring disturbance. It is found that ‘two-sided’ dislocations are stable in a symmetric in-phase configuration, and that they induce quasi-periodic velocity spectra and (beat) dislocation-frequency oscillations in the near wake. Intrinsic to these dislocations is a mechanism by which they spread rapidly in the spanwise direction, involving helical twisting of the vortices and axial core flows. This is felt to be a fundamental mechanism by which vortices develop large-scale distortions in natural transition. As the wake travels downstream, the energy at the low dislocation frequency decays slowly (in contrast to the rapid decay of other frequencies), leaving the downstream wake dominated by the large dislocation structures. Distinct similarities are found between the periodic forced dislocations and the intermittent dislocations that occur in natural transition. Further similarities of dislocations in different types of flow suggest that vortex or phase dislocations could conceivably be a generic feature of transition in all shear flows.},

abstract = {A series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of incompressible flow around a circular cylinder at Re = 3300 - based on the far field velocity and the diameter of the cylinder D - were performed. After taking an offset in the streamwise direction into account, the results were found to be in good agreement with experimental data obtained at a slightly higher Reynolds number of Re = 3900. Increasing the spanwise size of the computational domain from lz = 4 D s(-) 8 D was found to only marginally affect the profiles of turbulence statistics in the wake of the cylinder, although even in the simulation with lz = 8 D the spanwise autocorrelation of u did not completely converge to zero towards the sides of the computational domain. The phase-averaged statistics showed the existence of shear layers immediately downstream of the cylinder, which originated from the boundary layers along the top and bottom surface of the cylinder. As the shear layers rolled-up, significant production of turbulence kinetic energy was observed inside the rolls of recirculating flow. At x / D = 6 snapshots of the flow field were gathered. At this location, individual vortices - shed from the upper and lower shear layer, respectively, behind the cylinder - could still be identified. The gathered wake data will be used to study the influence of large meandering coherent structures on the promotion of laminar heat transfer along a body located downstream of the cylinder. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Development of coherent structures in the separated shear layer and wake of an airfoil in low-Reynolds-number flows was studied experimentally for a range of airfoil chord Reynolds numbers, 55103TRecT210103, and three angles of attack, $\alpha$=0, 5 and 10. To illustrate the effect of separated shear layer development on the characteristics of coherent structures, experiments were conducted for two flow regimes common to airfoil operation at low Reynolds numbers: (i) boundary layer separation without reattachment and (ii) separation bubble formation. The results demonstrate that roll- up vortices form in the separated shear layer due to the amplification of natural disturbances, and these structures play a key role in flow transition to turbulence. The final stage of transition in the separated shear layer, associated with the growth of a sub-harmonic component of fundamental disturbances, is linked to the merging of the roll-up vortices. Turbulent wake vortex shedding is shown to occur for both flow regimes investigated. Each of the two flow regimes produces distinctly different characteristics of the roll-up and wake vortices. The study focuses on frequency scaling of the investigated coherent structures and the effect of flow regime on the frequency scaling. Analysis of the results and available data from previous experiments shows that the fundamental frequency of the shear layer vortices exhibits a power law dependency on the Reynolds number for both flow regimes. In contrast, the wake vortex shedding frequency is shown to vary linearly with the Reynolds number. An alternative frequency scaling is proposed, which results in a good collapse of experimental data across the investigated range of Reynolds numbers.},

The basic equation used to define the drag coefficient is inapplicable for very low aspect ratio and the projected area should be replaced by the side area. Surface flow visualization tests in a wind tunnel reveal the variation in both shape and size of separation bubbles, which form on the flat sides of the model. A crescent-shaped area is observed between the primary and secondary separation, followed by an unsteady re-attachment region. A strong hysteresis effect is observed in the development of the separation bubbles. The separation bubbles can be suppressed by rounding the sharp edges of the model, with considerable reduction in the drag coefficient. Finally, a flow topology is suggested consisting of two horseshoe vortices attached onto the flat sides and detached in a streamwise direction, thus forming two counter-rotating vortex pairs.},

All means are described in detail and the reasons for their effectiveness explained. A comparative assessment of effectiveness is attempted and the need for comparative tests of various means under identical model conditions is stressed. The reduction of effectiveness in the post-synchronisation range, at high intensity of turbulence, and due to multi-cylinder interference is emphasised.},

@article{Zhang1995,
abstract = {The transition of the cylinder wake is investigated experimentally in a water channel and is computed numerically using a finite-difference scheme. Four physically different instabilities are observed: a local "vortex-adhesion mode," and three near-wake instabilities, which are associated with three different spanwise wavelengths of approximately 1, 2, and 4 diam. All four instability processes can originate in a narrow Reynolds-number interval between 160 and 230, and may give rise to different transition scenarios. Thus, Williamson's [Phys. Fluids 31, 3165 (1988)] experimental observation of a hard transition is for the first time numerically reproduced, and is found to be induced by the vortex-adhesion mode. Without vortex- adhesion, a soft onset of three-dimensionality is numerically and experimentally obtained. A control-wire technique is proposed, which suppresses transition up to a Reynolds number of 230. ©},

@article{Ziada2005,
abstract = {A bare tube and three segmented-finned tubes have been tested to investigate the effect of the fins on vortex shedding from cylinders in cross-flow. The addition of the fins is found to enhance the process of vortex shedding. It is shown that the fins increase the correlation length and the amplitude of velocity fluctuation at the vortex shedding frequency. The fins also increase the nonlinear nature of the flow in the wake, as evidenced by a remarkable increase in the number and in the amplitude of the higher harmonic components of vortex shedding. However, the correlation length in the wake of the finned tubes is found to change with angular rotation of the tube around its axis. This phenomenon seems to be related to an irregular wavy pattern of the fin distribution along the tube axis. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
