	abstract = {In this article we present parallel 3D finite element computation of unsteady incompressible flows around circular cylinders. We employ stabilized finite element formulations to solve the Navier-Stokes equations on a thinking machine CM-5 supercomputer. The time integration is based on an implicit method, and the coupled, nonlinear equations generated every time step are solved iteratively, with an element-vector based evaluation technique. This strategy enables us to carry out these computations with millions of coupled, nonlinear equations, and thus resolve the flow features in great detail. At Reynolds number 300 and 800, our results indicate strong 3D features arising from the instability of the columnar vortices forming the Karman street. At Re = 10000 we employ a large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {We investigate the laminar shedding of hairpin vortices in the wake of a truncated square cylinder placed in a duct, for Reynolds numbers around the critical threshold of the onset of vortex shedding. We single out the formation mechanism of the hairpin vortices by means of a detailed analysis of the flow patterns in the steady regime. We show that unlike in previous studies of similar structures, the dynamics of the hairpin vortices are entwined with that of the counter-rotating pair of streamwise vortices, which we found to be generated in the bottom part of the near wake (these are usually referred to as ‘base vortices’). In particular, once the hairpin structure is released, the base vortices attach to it, forming its legs, so these are streamwise, and not spanwise as previously observed in unconfined wakes or behind cylinders of lower aspect ratios. We also single out a trail of Ω-shaped vortices, generated between successive hairpin vortices through a mechanism that is analogous to that active in near-wall turbulence. Finally, we show how the dynamics of the structures we identified determine the evolution of the drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers when the Reynolds number varies.},

A kind of three-dimensional vortex-shedding mechanism associated with the inviscid Kelvin-Helmholtz-instability has been identified to govern the flow field in both cases. The time-averaged velocity distribution is strongly affected by these vortex cascades although the unsteadiness of the bubbles due to the band of frequencies in the spectra of the vortex-shedding mechanism is hidden. Several analyzing methods are used and/or developed and the capabilities of more sophisticated experimental investigations of the three-dimensional flow field associated with separation bubbles are outlined.},

The authors lead the reader through the fundamental mathematical principles underlying the operation of key signal processing techniques, providing simple arguments and cases rather than detailed general proofs. Coverage of practical implementation, discussion of the limitations of particular methods and plentiful MATLAB illustrations allow readers to better connect theory and practice. A focus on algorithms that are of theoretical importance or useful in real-world applications ensures that students cover material relevant to engineering practice, and equips students and practitioners alike with the basic principles necessary to apply DSP techniques to a variety of applications. Chapters include worked examples, problems and computer experiments, helping students to absorb the material they have just read. Lecture slides for all figures and solutions to the numerous problems are available to instructors"--},

For this, a Strouhal number relating a peak frequency in the turbulence spectrum to the velocity of the flow is required. The data available in the literature for this are rather confusing and the prediction methods appear somewhat contradictory. This paper reports the results from experiments conducted to determine Strouhal numbers for eight tube array models. These results together with the data available in the literature are then compared and appropriate conclusions drawn.},

Day trading by individual investors is prevalent in Taiwan – accounting for over 20 percent of total volume from 1995 through 1999. Individual investors account for over 97 percent of all day trading activity. Day trading is extremely concentrated. About one percent of individual investors account for half of day trading and one fourth of total trading by individual investors. Heavy day traders earn gross profits, but their profits are not sufficient to cover transaction costs. Moreover, in the typical six month period, more than eight out of ten day traders lose money. Despite these bleak findings, there is strong evidence of persistent ability for a relatively small group of day traders. Traders with strong past performance continue to earn strong returns. The stocks they buy outperform those they sell by 62 basis points per day. This spread is sufficiently large to cover transaction costs.},

Retail investors had negative abnormal returns on a gross excess return basis that ranged between 4\% and 4.4\% per year (depending on whether the alpha was estimated using the CAPM, Fama-French model or Carhart model). When transaction costs are considered, the underperformance of retail investors becomes even more pronounced, and the most active traders perform worse than less active traders even on a gross excess return basis. The underperformance of retail investors can be explained by their bad timing but only prior to the bankruptcy of Interbolsa, the largest stock brokerage house in Colombia at the time (2012). Once we control for the number of trades and other variables, we ﬁnd that retail investors present in the market for a longer period of time and trading more actively outperform the other investors (on both a gross and net basis).},

Only aggressive orders correctly predict ﬁrm news, including earnings surprises, suggesting they convey novel cash ﬂow information.

However, older investors are less effective in applying their investment knowledge and exhibit worse investment skill, especially if they are less educated, earn lower income, and belong to minority racial/ethnic groups. Overall, the adverse effects of aging dominate the positive effects of experience. These results indicate that older investors’ portfolio decisions reﬂect greater knowledge about investing, but investment skill deteriorates with age due to the adverse effects of cognitive aging.},

	doi = {10.1162/089976600300014971},
	abstract = {An algorithm is introduced that trains a neural network to identify chaotic dynamics from a single measured time series. During training, the algorithm learns to short-term predict the time series. At the same time a criterion, developed by Diks, van Zwet, Takens, and de Goede (1996) is monitored that tests the hypothesis that the reconstructed attractors of model-generated and measured data are the same. Training is stopped when the prediction error is low and the model passes this test. Two other features of the algorithm are (1) the way the state of the system, consisting of delays from the time series, has its dimension reduced by weighted principal component analysis data reduction, and (2) the user-adjustable prediction horizon obtained by “error propagation”—partially propagating prediction errors to the next time step.
            The algorithm is first applied to data from an experimental-driven chaotic pendulum, of which two of the three state variables are known. This is a comprehensive example that shows how well the Diks test can distinguish between slightly different attractors. Second, the algorithm is applied to the same problem, but now one of the two known state variables is ignored. Finally, we present a model for the laser data from the Santa Fe time-series competition (set A). It is the first model for these data that is not only useful for short-term predictions but also generates time series with similar chaotic characteristics as the measured data.},

	abstract = {In this paper a distinction is made between two types of personal saving, one of which is tax deductible and another which is not, and the role of each is examined within the framework of a life-cycle model. More precisely, the model shows how tax-deductible RRSP saving enables the individual to do his own lifetime income 'averaging' for tax purposes in order to generate the lifetime profile of taxable income which minimizes the discounted value of tax payments. The use of RRSPS for this purpose, however, does not usually result in income averaging in the conventional sense, since it is not necessarily optimal for a person to equalize taxable income over each period of his lifetime. By contrast, non-tax-deductible saving permits the individual to choose his optimal lifetime consumption path and bequests.},

Relying on clear physical arguments and examples, Mcleanprovides a much-needed, fresh approach to this sometimes contentious subject without shying away from addressing "real" aerodynamic situations as opposed to the oversimplified ones frequently used for mathematical convenience. Motivated by the belief that engineering practice is enhanced in the long run by a robust understanding of the basics as well as real cause-and-effect relationships that lie behind the theory, he provides intuitive physical interpretations and explanations, debunking commonly-held misconceptions and misinterpretations, and building upon the contrasts provided by wrong explanations to strengthen understanding of the right ones. Provides a refreshing view of aerodynamics that is based on the author's decades of industrial experience yet is always tied to basic fundamentals. Provides intuitive physical interpretations and explanations, debunking commonly-held misconceptions and misinterpretations Offers new insights to some familiar topics, for example, what the Biot-Savart law really means and why it causes so much confusion, what "Reynolds number" and "incompressible flow" really mean, and a real physical explanation for how an airfoil produces lift.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the interaction of two co-rotating trailing vortices. It is 
well-known that vortices of like-sign ultimately merge to form a single vortex, and 
there has been much work on measuring and predicting the initial conditions for the 
onset of merger, especially concerning the critical vortex core radius. However, the 
physical mechanism causing this merger has received little attention. In this work, 
we directly measure the structure of the antisymmetric vorticity field that causes the 
co-rotating vortices to be pushed towards each other during merger. We discover 
that the form of the antisymmetric vorticity comprises two counter-rotating vortex 
pairs, whose induced velocity field readily pushes the two centroids together. The 
merging velocity computed from the antisymmetric vorticity field agrees closely with 
the merging velocity measured directly from the total (original) flow field.
            
              The co-rotating vortex pair evolves through four distinct phases. The initial stage 
comprises a diffusive growth, which can be either viscous or turbulent. In either case, 
the number of turns that they rotate around one another until the vortices start 
to merge increases with Reynolds number (
              Re
              ). If one observes the streamlines in 
a rotating reference frame (moving with the vortices), then one finds an inner and 
outer recirculating region of the flow bounded by a separatrix streamline. When the 
vortices grow large enough in the first stage, diffusion across the separatrix places 
vorticity into the outer recirculating region of the flow, and this leads to the generation 
of the antisymmetric vorticity, causing convective merger. This second (convective) 
stage corresponds to the motion of the vortex centroids towards each other, and is a 
process which is almost independent of viscosity. During the late part of this stage, 
the antisymmetric vorticity is diminished by a symmetrization process, and the final 
merging into one vorticity structure is achieved by a second diffusive stage. The fourth 
and ultimate phase is one where the merged vortex core grows by diffusion.},

The aim is to devise a method to simulate ﬂow past an immersed moving body that avoids the intensive remeshing of the computational domain and minimizes data interpolation associated with the established computational ﬂuid methodologies; as such procedures are time consuming and are a signiﬁcant source of error in ﬂow simulation. In the present scheme, the moving body is embedded and enveloped by a cloud of mesh-free nodes, which convects with the motion of the body against a background of Cartesian nodes. The generalized ﬁnite-diﬀerence (GFD) method with weighted least squares (WLS) approximation is used to discretize the two-dimensional viscous incompressible Navier–Stokes equations at the mesh-free nodes, while standard ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximations are applied elsewhere. The convecting motion of the mesh-free nodes is treated by the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the ﬂow equations, which are solved by a second-order Crank–Nicolson based projection method. The proposed numerical scheme was tested on a number of problems including the decaying-vortex ﬂow, external ﬂows past moving bodies and body-driven ﬂows in enclosures.},

It was found that higher levels of secondary freestream turbulence did not increase the peak turbulence intensity observed within the mixing layer, but slightlyincreased the growth rate. Higher levels of freestream turbulence also reduced the axial distance required for development of the mean velocity. At higher convective Mach numbers, the mixing layer growth rate was found to be smaller than that of an incompressible mixing layer at the same velocity and freestream density ratio. The increase in convective Mach number also caused a decrease in the turbulence intensity (\%/A U).},

Experiments are carried out in a water flume facility using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and hydrogen bubble flow visualization. The results show that four distinct vortex shedding regimes can be identified based on changes in large cylinder wake development. Depending on the geometrical parameters of the dual-step cylinder, the wake of the large cylinder may involve (i) vortex shedding at a frequency lower than that expected for a uniform cylinder at the same Reynolds number, (ii) irregular shedding, (iii) vortex shedding at a frequency higher than that for a uniform cylinder, and (iv) suppression of large cylinder vortex shedding. Based on the present results and those from previous studies on relevant geometries, a map of wake regimes for a dual-step cylinder has been constructed.},

A single step cylinder is comprised of two cylinders of different diameters (D and d). Experiments were performed at a Reynolds number (ReD) of 1050 and a diameter ratio (D/d) of two. A combination of hydrogen bubble and laser induced fluorescence techniques allowed visualization of complex vortex dynamics in the near wake. The results show that turbulent vortex shedding from a single step cylinder occurs in three distinct cells of constant shedding frequency. The differences in frequency and strengths between vortices in the cells lead to complex vortex interactions at the cell boundaries. The results demonstrate that vortex splitting, half-loop vortex connections, and direct cross-boundary vortex connections occur near the cell boundaries. A comparative analysis of flow visualizations and velocity measurements is used to characterize the main vortex cells and the attendant vortex interactions, producing a simplified model of vortex dynamics in the step cylinder wake for ReD = 1050 and D/d = 2.},

              , and three angles of attack, α = 0°, 5° and 10°. To illustrate the effect of separated shear layer development on the characteristics of coherent structures, experiments were conducted for two flow regimes common to airfoil operation at low Reynolds numbers: (i) boundary layer separation without reattachment and (ii) separation bubble formation. The results demonstrate that roll-up vortices form in the separated shear layer due to the amplification of natural disturbances, and these structures play a key role in flow transition to turbulence. The final stage of transition in the separated shear layer, associated with the growth of a sub-harmonic component of fundamental disturbances, is linked to the merging of the roll-up vortices. Turbulent wake vortex shedding is shown to occur for both flow regimes investigated. Each of the two flow regimes produces distinctly different characteristics of the roll-up and wake vortices. The study focuses on frequency scaling of the investigated coherent structures and the effect of flow regime on the frequency scaling. Analysis of the results and available data from previous experiments shows that the fundamental frequency of the shear layer vortices exhibits a power law dependency on the Reynolds number for both flow regimes. In contrast, the wake vortex shedding frequency is shown to vary linearly with the Reynolds number. An alternative frequency scaling is proposed, which results in a good collapse of experimental data across the investigated range of Reynolds numbers.},

Measurements of cross-sectional velocity proﬁles and longitudinal pressure distributions along the wall centerlines are carried out in a contraction prototype and the results are compared to those predicted by the numerical simulations. Finally, the applicability of the nozzle design method, proposed by Fang (ASME J. Fluid Eng. (1997) 454), is assessed. Results show that although the inviscid calculation fails to simulate correctly the part of the nozzle ﬂow near the contracting walls, the general behavior of the ﬂow in the regions away from the wall is in reasonable agreement with the predicted behavior. On the other hand, the relative friction losses along the wall centerlines are about 4.3\% relative to the total pressure drop through the contracting duct. After an adjustment is made in the normalization scheme, the measured pressure distributions are in good agreement with the numerically based distribution. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {A finite-element approach for calculating pressure fields from planar velocity data is examined in this paper and compared with widely cited procedures. In the current approach, the order of velocity derivatives in the source function is reduced via a finite-element procedure where the pressure Poisson equation is solved. This method benefits from the homogeneous spread of information in the Poisson solvers while preventing the magnification of velocity uncertainties. These combined features enable the method to limit the propagation of uncertainties into the computed pressure field. A cut-cell approach along fluid–solid boundaries is proposed, which enables information on moving, immersed boundaries to be passed into the pressure estimation procedure, thereby significantly reducing the pressure errors along the boundary. The finite-element method is validated using three canonical laminar flows where the “ground-truth” pressure and velocity fields are obtained from analytical solutions and numerical simulations. The accuracy of the finite-element approach is first investigated as a function of imposed noise in the velocity field data without any boundary treatments. The resulting pressure field is compared with existing pressure estimation procedures. The finite-element method performs agreeably for all flow fields of interest, with approximately a 7\% decrease in the pressure computation error for one of the flows, when compared to existing approaches. Next, the inclusion of boundary treatments is considered, where the implementation of the cut-cell approach is shown to reduce pressure estimation errors at solid–fluid boundaries when compared with existing boundary treatment methods. The findings are most pronounced for moving boundaries, where an order of magnitude decrease in the pressure estimation error along the moving surface is observed. This is because, when paired with the finite-element approach, the cut-cell method incorporates the surface dynamics in the pressure solution, whereas existing solution approaches do not have this capability.},
